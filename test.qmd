# First Section

<!-- Creates a slide -->
## First slide


## Second slide

<!-- Incremental lists -->
::: {.incremental} 
- One
- Two
- Three 
:::

In than fade-out requires quite a lot of work and is annooying, but can be done

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Three
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

<!-- How to add alerts and reference figures that are code generated -->
## Third slide
For a [demonstration](alert) of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

using Plots

x = collect(1:0.1:100)
f(x) = x^3 - 2*x +  5

plot(f.(x), legend=false)
```

<!-- Displaying code -->
## Fourth slide: code

```julia
using Plots

x = collect(1:0.1:100)
f(x) = x^3 - 2*x +  5

plot(f.(x), legend=false)
```


# New section


## Math!

Testing inline equation $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$

:::{math}
\begin{align}
Ax & = b \\
Bx + Dy & = e 
\end{align}
:::


# Third section

<!-- Multi-column layout -->
## Multi-column layout, aside and footnotes

::: aside
Some additional commentary of more peripheral interest.
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Left column^[A footnote on left column]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Right column

<!-- Using callouts is a nice feature this allows -->
## Admonitions (call outs)

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Warning with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

Other types:

::: {.callout-important }
## Important
:::

::: {.callout-tip }
## Tip
:::

::: {.callout-caution }
## Caution
:::

<!-- Adding a figure -->
## Image and text

Here is an image (@fig-chameleon):

![A picture of a chameleon](figures/image.png){#fig-chameleon .lightbox}

The image is clickable (lightbox)

<!-- Animations -->
## Animations {auto-animate=true}

Animations are automatically generated, by matching element between two successive slides.

::: {style="margin-top: 100px;"}
Make this big and red
::: 


## Animations {auto-animate=true}

Animations are automatically generated, by matching element between two successive slides.

::: {style="margin-top: 100px; font-size: 3em; color: red;"}
Make this big and red
:::

For it to work it must have the sme words, otherwise it reverts to a simple, appearance effect, like this


## Animations {auto-animate=true}

It matches where previous text went and auto-animate


## Animations {auto-animate=true}

It matches where previous text went and auto-animate

It also works with text and math

:::{math}
\begin{align*}
  \min & f(x) \\
  & g(x) \le 0 
\end{align*}
:::


## Animations {auto-animate=true}

It matches where previous text went and auto-animate

It also works with text and math

But not increments, only fade-in and displacement

:::{math}
\begin{align*}
  \min & f(x) \\
  & g(x) \le 0 
\end{align*}
:::


## Animations with code {auto-animate=true}

Code envs are automatically picked up for a nicer animation transition

```julia
using Plots

x = collect(1:0.1:100)
```


## Animations with code {auto-animate=true}
