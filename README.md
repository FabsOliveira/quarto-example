# Presentation template

This is a presentation template for making revealjs presentations using [quarto](https://quarto.org/). 

## How to use

First, you need to install quarto and configure VSCode or your favourite interface (the quarto documentation explains it well).

The easiest way to use it is to clone it and edit it. This has a `gamma-opt.scss` style file that makes some adjustments using our colours and logo at the bottom.
